              <p>Flora is the name given to the collective plant life that grows or once grew in a certain area or during a given time period. It usually
                 refers to the native plant life present but does include new  species that have been introduced as well.
                 Plantlife on the earth can be distinguished from each other in a number of ways.The simplest is to divide on the basis of region. Plants that grow specifically in
                 the mountains will be very different from those that grow in the desert.
                 Similarly, the plants that have adapted to living underwater are treated as a unique form of flora. Scientists can also study ‘Fossil Flora’, which comprises of plant life 
                 that was found in pre-historic times. The current flora and fauna of the earth are also divided on the basis of the environment in which it is grown or seen naturally.          
                  When we talk about ‘Native Flora’, we are referring to the plant life that is indigenous to a particular region. Cacti are the native flora of deserts all over
                  the world. They can grow in most weather conditions but are native to the sandy dunes of deserts. When we refer to ‘Agricultural Flora’, we are talking about plant life that
                   has been grown by humans for a certain purpose.

               <p>Fauna on the other hand, is the  name given to collective animal life that lives or was once found in a certain area or time period.
               Both the flora and fauna of the earth have been given sub-divisions. Fauna is also distinguished in many different ways. However, these ways are much more complex than floral divisions because animal life has evolved into many different forms.
                To begin with, the animal kingdom by itself is Fauna. However, within it we have the ‘Avifauna’ that refers to the birds and ‘Piscifauna’ referring to the fish. These are simpler classifications, since they do not cover small single-celled organisms such as bacteria and virus.
                  They also do not account for the microscopic organisms that abound in nature but cannot be seen by the human eye. Such animal life is known as ‘Microfauna’. </p>

                <h2 style="color:rgb(219, 25, 25);"> Endangered Species</h2>
                <p> There are now 41,415 species on the IUCN Red List, and 16,306 of them are endangered species threatened with extinction. There are now 41,415 species on the IUCN Red List, and 16,306 of them are endangered species threatened with extinction. Through deforestation, overfishing, and poaching, human intervention has brought these species near annihilation.
                    The species endangered include one in four mammals, one in eight birds, one third of all amphibians and 70% of the world’s assessed plants on the 2007 IUCN Red List are in jeopardy of extinction. The total number of extinct species has reached 785 and a further 65 are only found in captivity or in cultivation. In the last 500 years, human activity has forced over 800 species into extinction.
                    The current extinction crisis is unique, in that the loss of biodiversity is occurring very rapidly, and the causes of the crisis are the activities of a single species: human beings. Some scientists believe the current crisis began when humans and their domestic animals first began to colonize the various parts of the globe.</p>
